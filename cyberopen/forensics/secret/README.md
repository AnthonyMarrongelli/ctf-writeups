# Secret

We managed to get an informant to obtain a document which we believe might contain information confirming alien existence, but it is too censored.

## Challenge

In this challenge we are given a pdf with what seems to have redacted information.

But upon further investigation we can see that the pdf was just "redacted" by covering the background of secret text with the same color as the text so it appears as a blob. The underlying text is still there and we can see it when we highlight the pdf.
